<p>Boundaries between parts are how MIME attachments work, but usually scanning the part for the boundary is skipped, or just really expensive, so a part could divide unexpectedly into two broken parts. The answer is to discard boundaries entirely, and only have the message link to its parts. <a href="hashtree.html">Everything</a> can be <a href="piecedb.html">represented as pieces</a> so set max piece size to 0xffff. Then a 2 byte size header followed by the piece is something you can just append bytewise, to produce a message plus what it links to, like how email does attachments. No boundaries needed since the size of each piece is recorded, thus can use binary encoding, no escape characters.</p>
