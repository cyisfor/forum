<p>MIME sucks because it's a format that can't be read one piece at a time, only loaded as a whole into memory at once. Some hacks around this, but they don't work well. MIME multipart encoding is an afterthought, and only limited forms of multipart data are allowed, only two in most browsers. MIME sucks because <a href="boundaries.html">boundaries</a> are just assumed not to be found in the body of the parts, so there's a (small) risk that your email will be unreadable by a computer. And MIME sucks because <a href="pgp.html">PGP/MIME ...sucks</a>.</p>
