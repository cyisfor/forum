<p>Linking is better than embedding in all respects, except that 1) the result of the link can change thus ruining any immutability or reliability of a document using links, and 2) the result of the link can be unavailable since it's not included embedded inside the document. For 1) use <a href="hashtree.html">CHKs</a> to link, so that the result can never change. For 2) you can <a href="boundaries.html">append pieces after the document</a> to have the same reliability as embedding, with more efficiency/space. Plus using CHKs lets everyone link to the same file, and each only download it once, unlike w/ email.</p>
