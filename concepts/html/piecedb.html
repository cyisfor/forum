<p>You don't want to receive a lot of data without verifying it. So crypto hashing large files is a bad idea. Could get flooded with large files with fake signatures. Nor do you want to store a lot of data without verifying it. Plus as bittorrent proves, getting pieces of a file out of order rocks for file transfers. So piecedb doesn't have files but instead pieces, which are sequences of bytes that have a fixed (arbitrary) maximum size. Each piece is hashed so it can be verified on its own. If you can get something into the piecedb, then you can easily send the pieces to your peers in any order, and they can swarm it, and others can relay it. Having a fixed maximum size (low as 0xffff to boot) may seem limiting, but <a href="hashtree.html">files of arbitary size</a> may be encoded into a piecedb, and recovered with a simple key of 33 bytes.</p>
