PGP will not sign the email headers, so your subject line, from address, to address, and many important things can be tampered with. PGP only signs the transport encoding of the email, not the email itself, when transport encoding should never be signed since it's legit to change it around as long as the email decodes properly in the end. PGP sucks because it uses a separate system entirely  from email to get someone's key. If they forget to attach it you better hope keyservers are online, accessible and responsive. And their database of keys being global, ever increasing, never expiring, has become huge, like, multi-gigabytes huge. At least it's not as bad as Bitcoin. PGP encryption also does not affect the headers, so you must leave your subject blank or misleading. Email readers should detect PGP and expand it into its own email, but they don't. Because recursion was never taken into account when designing this stuff.

Finally PGP signing sucks steaming monkey balls, because here's how it works. You calculate the transport encoding of your message. Then PGP takes the cryptographic hash of that entire message including attachments, except it ignores email headers because $reasons. Then PGP encrypts that hash with your private key, allowing anyone with your public key to decrypt it and verify that it's your signature, and thus verify that the hash represents the email you intended to send. That means a signature can only be verified after the entire email has arrived, no matter how big that email may be. There's no telling who the email is from, nor whether it's not what you wanted to get, until it's fully arrived. So people can flood you with giant emails with fakey fake signatures, and there's nothing you can do about it.

So anyway, back to <a href="email.html">email</a>
