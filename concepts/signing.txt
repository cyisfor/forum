Signing is surprisingly simple given <a href="hashtree.html">hash trees</a>. Suppose there's a file you want to sign. Get the root hash of its hash tree, combine w/ depth to make the file's URI. Then you sign that URI. Create a file with your public key, the signature, and that URI, and anyone can verify it's from you <u>before downloading anything else</u>. They don't even have to trust the subject or the mime type or the Received: lines without a signature to back them up. To send them this signature file, insert it into the piecedb, then send them the URI of that, and the pieces they're going to want. It's sort of like how PGP signs emails, except it's signing each piece of the email, so you can discard the ones someone else inserted in there without being able to sign for that.
